# Machine-Learning
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and experiments. Each project explores different machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques applied to various datasets. The goal is to provide practical examples and insights into the implementation of machine learning models for educational and reference purposes.


## Contents

### Gradient Descent

- **Gradient Descent Types of gradient descent**: This folder contains notebooks and resources related to different types of gradient descent algorithms, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent.

### Feature Engineering

- **embedded_methods.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates feature selection methods that are embedded within the algorithms, such as Lasso and Ridge regression.
- **filter-based-feature-selection.ipynb**: This notebook explores filter-based feature selection techniques, such as correlation and chi-square tests.
- **wrapper_methods.ipynb**: This notebook covers wrapper methods for feature selection, including techniques like recursive feature elimination (RFE).

### Linear Regression

- **multiple-linear-regression**: This folder contains scripts and notebooks related to multiple linear regression, including data preparation and model evaluation.
- **regression-metrics**: This folder provides scripts and notebooks for various regression metrics used to evaluate model performance, such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **simple-linear-regression**: This folder includes notebooks and scripts for implementing simple linear regression, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **polynomial-regression.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates polynomial regression, which is an extension of linear regression to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

## Usage

To use the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you will need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
