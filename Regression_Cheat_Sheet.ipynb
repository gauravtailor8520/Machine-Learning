        "**[Linear Regression](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.06-linear-regression.html)** - Linear Regression is a statistical model that seeks to describe the relationship between some y variable and one or more x variables (\"Line of Best Fit\").  A linear regression model that involves multiple x variables is known as Multiple Regression.\n",
        "- X - Independent Variable, predictor variable, explanatory variable, regressor, covariate\n",
        "- Y - Response variable, predicted variable, measured vairable, explained variable, outcome variable\n",
        "- $\\beta_0$ - \"Beta Naught\" or \"Beta Zero\", the intercept value. This is how much of y would exist if X were zero. This is sometimes represented by the letter \"a\" but I hate that. So it's \"Beta 0\" during my lecture.\n",
        "- $\\beta_1$ - \"Beta One\" The primary coefficient of interest. This values is the slope of the line that is estimated by \"minimizing the sum of the squared errors/residuals\" - We'll get to that.\n",
        "- $\\epsilon$ - \"Epsilon\" The \"error term\", random noise, things outside of our model that affect y.\n",

        "**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** - Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts, without considering their direction. It measures accuracy for continuous variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** - Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimator—it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** - The RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule which measures the average magnitude of the error. The difference between forecast and corresponding observed values are each squared and then averaged over the sample. Finally, the square root of the average is taken. Since the errors are squared before they are averaged, the RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors. This means the RMSE is most useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n",
        "- The MAE and the RMSE can be used together to diagnose the variation in the errors in a set of forecasts. The RMSE will always be larger or equal to the MAE; the greater difference between them, the greater the variance in the individual errors in the sample. If the RMSE=MAE, then all the errors are of the same magnitude\n",
        "- RMSE has the same units as the quantity being estimated\n",

        "**Residual Error** -  The distance between points in the dataset and some \"true\" value, usually the predicted values such as those along the regression line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bias** - Difference between estimators expected values and the true value. High bias is caused by erroneous assumptions. High Bias = Underfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variance** - The variability of model predictions for a given data point or value which tell the spread of the data.  High variance is a sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High Variance = Overfitting"

        "There are 6 Gauss Markov assumptions (also called conditions) that are required for OLS to be BLUE (the \"Best Linear Unbiased Estimator\").\n",

        "1) Well Defined: $X^{T}X$ is invertible (No perfect multicollinearity), $|X| \\neq 0$\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Linearity: the parameters we are estimating using the OLS method must be themselves linear.\n",
        "- When two variables are close to being a linear combination of each other we call this **collinearity** or having high levels of collinearity. If there are three of more variables all with significant levels of collinearity we call this \"multicollinearity\" but the two terms are used interchangeably.\n",
        "- High levels of Collinearity in a dataset is bad because it increases standard errors and therefore makes estimates of our coefficients less precise. Very high levels of collinearity (nearing perfect multicollinearity can cause standard errors to grow drastically.)\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Random: our data must have been randomly sampled from the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Non-Collinearity: the regressors (x vars) being calculated aren’t perfectly (or highly) correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Exogeneity: the regressors (x vars) aren’t correlated with the error term.\n",

        "- Instrumental Variables: A regression of education on earnings would be biased both education and ability are both influenced by influenced by natural ability. We use an additional \"Instrumental Variable\" that is correlated with of schooling and earnings but isn't correlated with ability in order to estimate the effect of years of schooling on earnings. (Month of birth - Angrist and Kreuger)\n",
